User tryhackme may run the following commands on sudo-privesc:
    (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash

if you see anything like this after running sudo -l command this means user cannot run /bin/bash as root 

For those who might be unfamiliar with it: sudo is a command in unix that allows you to execute programs as other users. This usually defaults to the superuser (root),
but it's also possible to execute programs as other users by specifying their username or UID. For example, sudo would usually be used like so: sudo <command>, 
but you could manually choose to execute it as another user like this: sudo -u#<id> <command>. 
This means that you would be pretending to be another user when you executed the chosen command, which can give you higher permissions than you might otherwise have had.
